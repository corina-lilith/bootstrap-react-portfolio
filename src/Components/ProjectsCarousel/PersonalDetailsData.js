    brief: 'An offshoot of PoleGuide, this app focuses on a single pole studio in Brisbane: CSolta.',
    feature1: 'Teacher logs in and can view a variety of moves sorted into categories. From those moves, the teacher is able to select and assign each one to the available classes. This lesson planning allows for a variety of moves for all classes, less research time, and more organisation.',
    feature2: 'A student is able to view the moves assigned to their class so they can remember what was covered and discover new moves they can request to learn. A future feature would be that students can rank their confidence levels for a move so the teacher can have real feedback and plan lessons effectively.',

    feature2: 'Another feature is that a user can upload images of themselves doing a pole move and by tagging the original image; other users can view both.',

    feature2: 'Number 3 is a random card selected from the list. Number 4 has a bit more interaction with the user entering their date of birth to get their star sign and element. Number 5 will print out their entire star chart details. Number 6 will give the details of the next full moon and 7 will exit the program with a "Goodbye" message an crystal ball emoji.',
